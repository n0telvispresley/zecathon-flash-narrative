# Strategic PR Impact Assessment & Performance Audit

## Zenith Bank Plc

## Period: October 2024 - March 2025

-----

### **1. Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive performance audit of Zenith Bank Plc's media and reputation landscape from October 2024 to March 2025.

Overall, Zenith Bank maintained a **dominant and highly positive (92.1%)** brand reputation, driven primarily by strong **Corporate Performance** (N350.4Bn Hybrid Capital Raise [cite: 563]) and the exceptional media prominence of its **CEO, Dr. Adaora Umeoji** [cite: 562].

Competitively, Zenith secured a **28% Share of Voice (SOV)**, placing it in a strong second position. It trails Access Bank (35%), which capitalized on high-visibility sponsorships, but significantly outperforms GTCO (20%) and a struggling First Bank (17%).

A key vulnerability has been identified in **Product/Service** sentiment. While low in volume (4% of all mentions), negative discussions around **"mobile app downtime"** and "transaction failures" are driving over 90% of all **'Anger'** sentiment.

Key recommendations include leveraging the CEO's strong profile to build trust, launching a proactive communications campaign to address app concerns, and integrating strategic messaging (MPI) into high-performing CSR and Corporate announcements to improve resonance.

### **2. SWOT Analysis**

  * **Strengths:**

      * **Strong Financials & Corporate News:** Overwhelmingly positive sentiment (92.1%) driven by successful capital raise and strong financial results [cite: 563].
      * **CEO Prominence:** Dr. Adaora Umeoji is a key asset, ranking \#1 in CEO media prominence [cite: 562], reinforcing leadership and stability.
      * **Balanced Thematic Coverage:** Strong performance in Corporate (40%) and CSR/ESG (25%) themes.

  * **Weaknesses:**

      * **Negative Product Sentiment:** A small but critical volume of 'Anger' sentiment is linked to mobile app performance, directly impacting customer trust.
      * **Low Message Penetration:** The "Enhancing E-Channel Services" campaign has a low MPI of 4.5%, indicating it is not cutting through the noise.
      * **Legal/Risk Exposure:** A minor but persistent negative narrative surrounding an EFCC court incident involving bank staff [cite: 563] requires monitoring.

  * **Opportunities:**

      * **Digital Banking Narrative:** Leverage the CBN's new directives on PoS geo-tagging [cite: 564] to reposition the "E-Channel" campaign around security and reliability, capturing the industry conversation.
      * **Consolidate SOV Lead:** With First Bank weakened by negative fraud press [cite: 563], Zenith has a clear opportunity to capture its market share and challenge Access Bank for the \#1 SOV position.

  * **Threats:**

      * **Competitor Sponsorship:** Access Bank's high-visibility sponsorships (Lagos City Marathon [cite: 563]) are effectively "buying" a larger Share of Voice.
      * **Industry-Wide Negativity:** Broad negative press about CBN fines [cite: 549] or sector-wide service issues can create a halo effect that impacts Zenith, regardless of its own performance.

### **3. Outcome & Insights**

*(This section mirrors the "Insight & Recommendation" Table 13 from the Fidelity Report)*

| Driver | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **01. CEO Performance** | Dr. Adaora Umeoji dominated CEO media prominence (37% SOV) [cite: 562]. Her mentions were 100% positive, linked exclusively to 'Corporate' and 'Leadership' themes, providing a powerful, stabilizing narrative for the brand. This strong executive visibility is a key competitive differentiator. |
| **02. Competitive Analysis** | Access Holdings (35%) led media coverage, leveraging its marathon sponsorship. Zenith (30%) held a strong second, driven by corporate news. GTCO (20%) was third, with a positive but smaller footprint. First Bank (15%) was last, with its coverage dominated by negative fraud and internal rift stories [cite: 563, 564]. |
| **03. Government Policy Watch** | The CBN's new directives on PoS geo-tagging and dormant account publication [cite: 564] are the top industry topics. While competitors were frequently mentioned (often negatively) alongside these, Zenith has an opportunity to lead the narrative by proactively communicating its compliance and digital security strengths. |
| **04. Sentiment Analysis** | Zenith's 92.1% positive sentiment is world-class. The 4.1% negative sentiment, however, is highly concentrated. Analysis shows it's driven by 'Product/Service' complaints (app downtime, transaction errors). This indicates a disconnect between high-level corporate performance and the daily customer experience. |
| **05. Analyst Advisory (Recommendations)** | 1. **Amplify Strength:** Double-down on promoting the successful "Hybrid Capital Raise" and Dr. Umeoji's leadership to reinforce market stability. <br> 2. **Address Weakness:** Launch a proactive PR campaign to address "app downtime" concerns. <br> 3. **Boost MPI:** Relaunch the "E-Channel" campaign, linking it to the new CBN PoS directive to showcase security. <br> 4. **Counter Competitors:** Use First Bank's negative press as a foil to launch a "Trust & Governance" campaign. |

### **4. Industry Landscape Overview**

The Nigerian banking sector remains highly dynamic, shaped by strict regulatory actions and a rapid shift to digital. The **Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)** has been the primary market-mover, with new directives on **PoS geo-tagging** and **dormant account publication** [cite: 564] setting the compliance agenda.

Negative sentiment across the industry was largely driven by **CBN fines** for regulatory breaches and widespread customer complaints about **digital service failures**.

On the stock market, banking stocks saw a rally driven by strong Q3 earnings and capital raising announcements, notably from **Zenith Bank** and **First Bank**, indicating high investor confidence despite regulatory pressures [cite: 564].
