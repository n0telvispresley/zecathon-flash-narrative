Tier-1 Banks Suffer N545bn Capital Erosion In 10-Day Market Crisis,"Investor sentiment on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) turned sharply negative over the past 10 trading days, leading to a massive N545.13 billion loss in market value across four Tier-1 banks GTCO Plc, Access Holdings Plc, Zenith Bank Plc, and United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc.
The sell-off, which analysts have attributed to heightened investor anxiety following comments by US President Donald Trump on Nigeria’s insecurity, has triggered widespread apathy and profit-taking in the local bourse.
Similarly, Zenith Bank Plc shed N139.64 billion, closing at N59.60 per share from N63.00 at the beginning of the month, while UBA Plc recorded a N82.08 billion loss over the 10-day trading window. Reacting to the sustained decline in the market, Mr. Aruna Kebira, Managing Director/CEO of Globalview Capital Limited, said the persistent sell-off was largely driven by what he described as the “Donald Trump effect” and a wave of profit-taking by investors.",https://newtelegraphng.com/tier-1-banks-suffer-n545bn-capital-erosion-in-10-day-market-crisis/,11/11/2025,New Telegraph,Zenith,"2,500",,

Zenith Bank grows earnings by 16 per cent in Q3,"Zenith Bank Plc grew its earnings by 16 per cent in the third quarter, from N2.9 trillion recorded in Q3 2024 to N3.4 trillion in Q3 2025.

The Group’s performance continues to demonstrate resilience, strong momentum, disciplined execution and an ability to deliver long-term shareholder value despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the bank said in a statement.

According to the financial results presented to the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) last week, the growth in gross earnings was driven by sustained growth in interest income, which grew by 41 per cent year-on-year to N2.7 trillion.

The growth in interest income was supported by a high-yield rate environment and an expansion in the bank’s investment portfolio. Despite the increase in interest expense by 22 per cent to N814 billion on the back of a tightening monetary cycle and a growth in its funding base, the bank was able to achieve a healthy net interest margin (NIM) of 12 per cent, as against 10 per cent in September 2024.

Non-interest income declined by 38 per cent to N535 billion, underpinned by a 60 per cent decline in trading gains, the report said. Profitability remained strong, with profit before tax (PBT) at N917 billion as against N1 trillion reported in September 2024.


Profit after tax (PAT) also declined by eight per cent to N764 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) came in at N18.60 as against N26.34 in September 2024, as the bank took bold measures to improve the quality of its loan portfolio.

The bank’s total assets grew by four per cent from N30 trillion in December 2024 to N31 trillion as at September 2025. This was largely supported by customer deposits, which rose by eight per cent to N23.7 trillion within the same period.

Gross loans declined by nine per cent to N10 trillion as of September 2025, while the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio improved to three per cent due to the write-off of non-performing loans.

Return on average equity (ROAE) and return on average assets (ROAA) stood at 23.3 per cent and 3.3 per cent, respectively. Cost of funds increased to 4.5 per cent, underscored by the broader elevated interest rate environment. The Group’s cost of risk stood at 10 per cent while the cost-to-income ratio rose to 45 per cent.

Coverage ratio and liquidity ratio remain solid and well within regulatory limits at 211.1 per cent and 53 per cent, respectively. This highlights the Bank’s strong capital position and liquidity profile as well as its ability to fund strategic growth opportunities. It also reflects its unwavering commitment to a prudent risk management, compliance and corporate governance culture.

Commenting on the results, the Group Managing Director/CEO, Dr Adaora Umeoji, said, “The bank’s robust performance is an attestation to the resilience of the Zenith brand, results-driven strategy, and the adaptability of our people in an evolving operating environment. We have fortified our capital base, reset our asset quality, and are well-positioned for sustainable and profitable growth.”",https://guardian.ng/business-services/zenith-bank-grows-earnings-by-16-per-cent-in-q3/,03/11/2025,Guardian NG,Zenith,"28,000",,

"Tropical Christmas Wonderland returns as Eko Hotels, Zenith Bank celebrate Nigerian creativity","Eko Hotels & Suites, in collaboration with Zenith Bank, is set to light up Lagos this December with the return of the Tropical Christmas Wonderland — an annual festive experience that has grown into one of Africa’s most anticipated holiday attractions.

For the third consecutive year, Zenith Bank is maintaining its position as a major sponsor of the event, reaffirming its long-standing commitment to supporting Nigeria’s tourism and hospitality industries. The partnership underscores a shared vision to promote Nigeria as a destination known for creativity, culture, and community-driven entertainment.

Nigeria’s tourism potential has often been described as vast yet underutilised, despite its rich cultural diversity and rising interest among both domestic and international visitors. Initiatives such as the Tropical Christmas Wonderland are increasingly being recognised as important platforms for showcasing the country’s cultural vibrancy and family-friendly attractions.

Speaking on the collaboration, Dr Iyadunni Gbadebo, Sales and Marketing Director at Eko Hotels, said the event aims to project a more uplifting narrative about Nigeria.

“Nigeria’s story is bigger than the challenges often highlighted in the media,” she said. “Through Tropical Christmas Wonderland, we are investing in experiences that tell a different story — one of joy, creativity, and community. Tourism is not just about travel; it’s about identity, and Zenith Bank has continued to play a vital role in shaping that identity.”

Zenith Bank hopeful of full-year performance, pays N51.3b dividends
Since its inception seven years ago, the Tropical Christmas Wonderland has evolved into a signature event, attracting thousands of families and tourists each December. It features carnival parades, culinary showcases, musical performances, and the popular Familympics competition — all designed to highlight Lagos as a hub of festive innovation and cultural expression.

Zenith Bank’s involvement extends beyond sponsorship. Its continued support has helped expand the scope and quality of the event, enabling organisers to deliver experiences that meet international standards and celebrate Nigerian craftsmanship. The collaboration also aligns with the bank’s broader corporate social responsibility efforts, particularly in youth engagement, local enterprise support, and community development.

Observers say the partnership represents a model of how private sector participation can enhance Nigeria’s image abroad while strengthening domestic tourism. Zenith Bank’s own tradition of the annual light display along Ajose Adeogun Street in Lagos has already become a symbol of festive unity and city pride, attracting visitors from across the country.

This December, as Eko Hotels transforms into what organisers call a “Kingdom of Lights,” both partners aim to reinforce Nigeria’s reputation as a destination where hospitality meets creativity. Their collaboration continues to illuminate how strategic partnerships between business and culture can redefine Nigeria’s place on the global tourism map.",https://guardian.ng/art/tropical-christmas-wonderland-returns-as-eko-hotels-zenith-bank-celebrate-nigerian-creativity/,28/10/2025,The Guardian,Zenith,"28,000",,

Fidelity Bank Partners with Mastercard on Cross-Border Payment Solution,"Fidelity Bank Plc has partnered with Mastercard to launch a new initiative aimed at enhancing cross-border payments and remittances in Nigeria. The new product, known as *Fidelity Send*, leverages Mastercard’s extensive global network to offer near-real-time and cost-effective outbound transactions.
